#### REST API

<hr>

- RESTful API is **_an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. _**
  
- Example - to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application. RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and efficient software communication standards.
  
<hr>

#### API

- An application programming interface (API) **_defines the rules that you must follow to communicates_** with other software systems
  
- Example, the timesheet application exposes an API that asks for an employee's full name and a range of dates. When it receives this information, it internally processes the employee's timesheet and returns the number of hours worked in that date range.

- Web API is like a gateway between clients and resources on the web

<hr>

#### REST

- Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that **_imposes conditions on how an API should work_**

- APIs that follow the REST architectural style are called REST APIs. Web services that implement REST architecture are called RESTful web services

<hr>

##### CLIENT REQUEST

###### Unique resource identifier

- The server identifies each resource with unique resource identifiers.

###### <u> Method </u>

- Developers often implement RESTful APIs by using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). An HTTP method tells the server what it needs to do to the resource. The following are four common HTTP methods:

###### <u> GET </u>

- to access resources that are located at the specified URL on the server

###### <u> POST </u>

- to send data to the server

###### <u> PUT </u>

- to update existing resources on the server

###### <u> DELETE </u>

- DELETE request to remove the resource
